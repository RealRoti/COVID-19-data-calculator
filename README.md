# Tutorial (Windows)
⚠️ The programme is in italian. I'll relase an international relase soon.

1) Donwload the .exe file ![here](https://github.com/RealRoti/COVID-19-data-calculator/releases/tag/exe)
2) Open CMD, type "cd <.exe file's directory>" and press enter

In "Inserisci il numero di positivi" you have to write the number of registered infections.
In "Inserisci abitanti del tuo paese" you have to write the number of inhabitants of your country or of the place under analysis.
Now the programme shows you the incidence rate.

In the second section you can calculate the positive date compared to the previous bulletin.
In "Inserisci il numero di positivi" you have to write the number of registered infections again.
In "Inserisci positivi nello scorso bollettino" you have to write the number of registered infections reported in the the previous bulletin.

In the last section you can calculate the average number of daily infected.
In "Inserisci positivi nello scorso bollettino" you have to write the number of registered infections reported in the the previous bulletin again.

That's it.
